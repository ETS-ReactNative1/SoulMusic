# MusicPru
This is an application for streaming music that can run in the background I created while learning React Native at [MindX - Technology School](https://mindx.edu.vn/). No API provided so the number of song is limited.

## Content

The project contains:

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) (v0.63.1)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) (v5.7.1)
- [React Redux](https://redux.js.org/) (v4.0.5)
- [React Native Linear Gradient](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-linear-gradient) (v2.5.6)
- [React Native Vector Icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) (v6.6.0)
- [React Native Video](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-video) (v4.4.5)
- [Realm](https://realm.io/) (v6.0.4)
- And more ...

## What I learnt

This is the first application I've ever created, so I learned the most basic things about React Native. What I found to be most important I have learnt is how to use hooks to better optimize my application. I also learnt other skills, such as networking, animating, using database, etc, but most meaningful, how to design and manage a project. 

## What need to be done

- Improve the layout of the project;
- Improve the readability and reusability of code (especially parts using Hooks);
- Improve the responsive of the app;
- Configure this project on iOS platform (FontAwesome5 currently causes the app to crash on iOS emulator);
- Add function that allows users to control the player at lock screen.

## Requirements

Node 8 or greater is required. Development for iOS requires a Mac and Xcode 9 or up, and will target iOS 9 and up.

Know about [React Native](https://reactnative.dev).

## Running the project

Assuming you have all the requirements installed, you can setup and run the project by running:

- `yarn install` or `npm i` to install the dependencies
- `react-native run-android` to run the Android application (remember to start a simulator or connect an Android phone)
- `react-native run-ios` to run the iOS application (remember to start a simulator or connect an iPhone phone)
